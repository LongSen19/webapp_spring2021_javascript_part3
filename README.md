Assignment: Classwork with Javascript Part 3 <br>
Description: In this classwork, we continue working on the COVID center app that we started in a previous classwork. We already have the HTML5 and CSS3 work done, and the purpose of this classwork is to add javascript to make it more interactive. In the previous classwork with javascript, we added some interactive elements with toggling visibility and validated the form by checking inputs for errors or special characters. In this classwork, we continue working with javascript. <br>
